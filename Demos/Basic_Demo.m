%	OVERVIEW:
%       This basic demo will allow you to load an ECG file in matlab 
%       compatible wfdb format, detect the locations of the R peaks,
%       perform signal quality (SQI) analysis and plot the results.
%
%   OUTPUT:
%       A figure with the loaded ECG signal and detected peaks will be
%       generated
